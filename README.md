# 📖 Project Overview

AI Disaster Response Commander is a web-based application developed to improve emergency response during disasters. The system allows users to report disaster locations on an interactive map and automatically recommends the nearest available ambulance, hospital, and rescue resources.

The application also maintains incident history, displays live statistics, and provides an AI-based decision panel to assist emergency coordinators.
